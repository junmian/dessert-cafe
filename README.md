# Dessert Cafe

## Motivation

This is a passion project which stems from my interest in building websites for small businesses.

## Design

The cafe menu was built using the mobile-first approach. By starting with the mobile end, which has more restrictions, it was a lot easier to size up to a desktop version.

## Learning Points

- Learned how to use a custom front, which is applied to the restaurant menu.
- Learned to optimize the use of CSS Grid with flexbox to create a responsive, mobile-friendly restaurant/cafe menu.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Version Control

- GitLab
